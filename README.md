# WordSearchApp
Android word search app for Shopify internship application

Summary: 

The application consists of a welcome screen and the game itself. Every time a new game is launched, the 10x10 grid is filled with random letters and the 6 words (ObjectiveC, Java, Kotlin, Variable, Swift, Mobile) are placed at random orientations and random spots. 

When the user clicks on a letter in the grid, it appears in the box below the grid. They can validate their input at any time using the "Check" button. This validates whether the input letters all appear in a straight line and form one of the designated words. A message appears to let the user know whether they have successfully found a word or not. When all the words have been found, a message congratulates the user and a "Return to Home" button appears at the bottom of the screen.
